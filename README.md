Task-2:->Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
techniques to tackle this problem. CodSoft

🎬 Excited to share my recent project during my Data Scientist Internship at CodSoft! 📊 I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project focused on Movie Rating Prediction using regression techniques. 🌟

🔍 Through extensive data analysis, preprocessing, and feature engineering, I delved into historical movie data to understand the underlying factors influencing ratings by users and critics alike. 📈

🔢 Utilizing univariate analysis on both numerical and categorical data, I uncovered valuable insights that contributed to the development of an accurate predictive model. 🧠

💡 This project not only honed my skills in data analysis and machine learning modeling but also provided me with a deeper understanding of the complexities involved in predicting movie ratings. 🤓

🚀 I'm proud to have been part of a team that's pushing the boundaries of data science in the entertainment industry. 🌟
